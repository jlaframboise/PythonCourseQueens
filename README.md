# Python Course
A Python programming class at Queen's University. 

I took this course during first semester of first year at Queen's University in 2018. In this repository is all the code I wrote while in lecture, studying for each exam, and the code for each of my assignments. 
This course looked at various programming data structures in Python liked linked lists.
It looked at techniques like recursion and functional decomposition. 

The biggest item in this repository is the culminating project at the end of the course, which is the longest assignment completed. 
This project involves making a mock control system for the bike network with a simple CLI interface. 

Some interesting examples of my work are in the recursive assigns. 
There is an implementation of a maze search in maze.py.
There are implementations of various sorts.
